				<h2 class="col-sm-8 text-left"><u>The Power of Studying History</u></h2>
				<p class="col-sm-8 text-left">By: Jeffrey J. Lee<br>January 2017</br></p>
				<h4 class="col-sm-7 text-left"><p>History is incredibly important to learn and understand. Building firsthand knowledge and experience is limited to the constraints of time. History is a fast, efficient way for anyone to augment their pool of knowledge and experience. Studying history is like living through multiple cycles of lifetime experiences - you can learn from others’ mistakes and successes and develop a deep understanding of how certain things came to be. Understanding the origins of the status quo gives you the insight and confidence to question the default and improve it.</p>
				<p>Most importantly though, studying history gives you an understanding of patterns and trends. People tend to focus on learning facts and information. A level above this is being able to connect the dots across disciplines and disparate ideas, cross-checking these to historical patterns and trends which allow you to forecast the future more accurately. This is why history is so powerful and why the best leaders all have a passion for studying history.</p>
				<p>I recently watched a CNN documentary on technology development during the 1980s. Watching and listening to how the media and public responded to transformative technologies of the time like the VHS, Walkman, camcorder, and answering machine was insightful and entertaining. “The Walkman allows you to take your music mobile.” “Arcades are now the new soda fountains of the binary generation.” “Binary generation” reminded me of “information superhighway”, phrases used to first describe new phenomena which quickly fell by the wayside. There was also one segment where Tom Hanks says “I couldn’t wait to check my voice messages at home.” Sony and Atari were the Apple and Google of the 80s. The phrase “history repeats itself” is true but needs clarification - while specific facts, names, companies, and people don’t repeat, the patterns and trends absolutely repeat over and over again.</p>
				<p>The personal computer was on the fringes and hobbyists furiously innovated in their garages. People like Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, Paul Allen, and Bill Gates saw the future of personal computing which the corporate suits of 1980s mega corporations like IBM and Xerox ignored. Before long, Apple and Microsoft turned the tables and became the technology powers of today. It’s fascinating to see historical events as they happened in real-time, as you simply change the facts/content and the patterns/trends remain exactly the same. History’s patterns and trends are a cycle that repeats constantly, even more so in today’s hyper connected world where people focus more on the short-term, micro-view and less on the long-term, macro-view.</p>
				<p>I can guarantee that Apple and Microsoft, and nearly every other top-10 market cap company today will eventually give way to new, innovative start-ups in the future. Future success, therefore, won’t look like past success. The successful entrepreneurs of the future won’t look like the past successes of software (Bill Gates), social media (Mark Zuckerberg), or oil (John D. Rockefeller). Future entrepreneurs will emerge from new industries and areas of innovation. While the facts and content will change, the patterns and trends will remain the same. The specific industries will change, but the patterns of how they get there and broader trends of growth will remain the same.</p>
				<p>The biggest, brightest opportunities are often where others shy away. There’s an incredible amount of groupthink and herd-like mentality in mainstream tech press and the VC community. For example, Singapore and Southeast Asia is entirely focused on FinTech and e-commerce. While these are themes I agree with, is there really a market need for another cryptocurrency wallet or the sixth mobile payment solution? These are sexy start-up ideas which don’t solve any real needs or add any value. Everything related to ecommerce is an obvious theme which every VC in the region is watching. A VC’s competitive advantage comes in one of two ways - either the VC gets to a deal first or sees opportunity where others don’t. Since everyone is watching ecommerce, the VC will only win if they get to a deal first. This leads to an arms race of building relationships and sourcing deals, all which can lead to poor, rushed decisions. Peter Thiel preaches that direct competition is bad since it leads to needlessly wasted resources. Yet, most VCs in Southeast Asia are doing just that.</p>
				<p>The smarter approach is to avoid direct competition. VCs should take the patterns learned from history, apply them to today’s landscape, and find opportunities in areas that are currently neglected. Is there a way to bring SaaS to the entire palm oil vertical? What solutions are available to the hundreds of millions of unbanked adults in Southeast Asia?</p>
				<p>Studying history can give you the foundational knowledge of patterns and trends to see the future. We can always use more entrepreneurs and VCs that can do this.</p>

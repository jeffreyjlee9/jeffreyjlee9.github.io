				<h2 class="col-sm-8 text-left"><u>Entrepreneurship v. (Corporate) Ladder</u></h2>
				<p class="col-sm-8 text-left">By: Jeffrey J. Lee<br>December 2016</br></p>
				<h4 class="col-sm-7 text-left"><p>From a very young age, our society breeds competition. Schools run a singular, rigid competition from age 5 (or younger with pre-k, nursery school, etc.) through age 18. In order to move on to the next level, you must achieve baseline targets. Teachers and parents measure you against your peers either explicitly (ex. Grading curve, standardized tests) or implicitly (ex. Neighborhood gossip) which further fuels competition to not only achieve the minimum, but to overachieve and be at the top. This competition also exists outside of the classroom in sports, music, and the arts. Those who are the most successful get the privilege to compete in increasingly greater competitive arenas, first university admissions, then some path consisting of summer internships, fresh grad banking/consulting jobs, grad school admissions, medical residency, and law clerkship. The competitive journey continues through corporate promotions and political maneuvering, all coming to an end with C-suite attainment, mindful satisfaction, or complete burnout. Competition is necessary to differentiate people and is oftentimes an effective means to do so. However, competition isn’t always a good thing.</p>
				<p>Early on in my career, I never understood why people kill themselves to win the “ladder” competition. I define the ladder as any positional hierarchy that involves a direct boss and internal politics, a structure you find at big corporations, medium sized firms, post Series B start-ups, your local store, and even academia. The ladder is ingrained through education and continues through professional life. I first realized this during my first semester of law school - people pursue 1L with a do or die mentality to get better grades than their peers and these 1L grades determine the firms for your summer internship interviews. After competing for law review and clerkships in between, you compete at your firm year after year to beat (or simply survive) your fellow associates for 6-8 years to achieve partnership. As a partner, you compete with other partners and firms for business, which you then do for the remaining 20-30 years of your career until retirement. While this generalizes the competition of law, it probably encapsulates the mindset and goals for 75% of incoming law students at any top 14 law school. Many people think I left law school because I couldn’t handle the work - I left because I kept questioning the purpose of all the artificial competitions I would have to engage in for the next 30 years of my life.</p>
				<p>Imagine taking all of that brainpower, effort, and energy put towards exams, applications, interviews, and internal politics and applying it towards solving a real-world problem. That’s the unfettered pursuit of self-discovery, joy, and deep satisfaction of delivering value to the world that comes with entrepreneurship. Rather than spending my life competing with others in artificial competitions, I want to spend it competing with other businesses on real world problems. Over the past few years though, I’ve been humbled by many entrepreneurial experiences and discovered that despite being entrepreneurial at my core, there’s pros and cons everyone must weigh between the competition of entrepreneurship and the corporate ladder.</p>

				<p>There’s clear pros and cons that come with entrepreneurship and the ladder which appeal to different people. There’s also an in-between, perhaps a new division within a multinational corporation, that blends many of the pros and cons. I also realize that entrepreneurship or even the ladder aren’t always possible or accessible for everyone and am grateful that they’re both viable options. For me, entrepreneurship offers the most attractive rewards, despite the hard, brutal journey it requires because it aligns best with my values and what I want to do with my life. Furthermore, success in the ladder requires different skills and different drive (ex. Maneuvering internal politics, toughing out a role for years before promotion) which I know I’m not good at. I believe the best situation is to work in 2-4 different organizations to hone your skills and figure out your own entrepreneurial journey.</p>
				<p>There’s a public reverence and celebration of the biggest, richest, most famous entrepreneurs and C-suite executives, with their visibility and definitions of success amplified by the internet’s many channels. It’s extremely difficult but important to figure out your career goals and pursuits independently from what’s promoted on the internet, media, and your peers. I’m still figuring it out myself, but I believe you must prioritize your life values, identify your own metrics of success, and take risks stepping outside of your comfort zone, learning and exploring the unknown to figure out what you really want in your career and your life.</p>
				<p>In the end, there’s no single, clear answer. Whether you commit to the competitions in entrepreneurship or in the corporate ladder comes down to what’s most important to you - how you value things in your life and how you define success. Your values will always be open to evaluation, evolving as you learn and age. Find the will and confidence to push into unfamiliar territory and continue building your values and your model of the world.</p>

				<h2 class="col-sm-8 text-left"><u>The Problem with Tech in Singapore</u></h2>
				<p class="col-sm-8 text-left">By: Jeffrey J. Lee<br>January 2017</br></p>
				<h4 class="col-sm-7 text-left"><p>In my essay on the power of studying history, I briefly explored how the biggest, brightest opportunities are often where others shy away. If you have an idea and most people say it’s bad, more often than not, you’re probably on the right path. If it’s such a good, obvious idea, someone would have done it already! Unfortunately, there’s an incredible amount of groupthink and herd-like mentality in mainstream tech press and the VC community. This problem particularly stands out in Singapore, which can be explained by 3 main factors.</p>
				<p><b>1) Education System</b> - Asia’s education system is well known for producing some of the highest marks in the world in standardized tests across all subjects. This comes from an overt emphasis on fact memorization and academic intelligence. From a young age, based on single nationwide exams, students are stratified into academic classes. Artistic, Athletic, and Emotional intelligence is relegated and creativity is penalized. When people are taught from a young age to conform and are labeled based on exam results, how can you expect them to think outside of the box and take risks as working professionals?</p>
				<p><b>2) Free Speech Limitations</b> - The Singaporean government severely limits freedom of speech and press. Political, racial, and religious content is highly censored and people aren’t allowed to freely express their opinions. In a society that punishes freedom of expression and diversity of thought in core matters, how can you expect new, radical ideas to drive business and entrepreneurship?</p>
				<p><b>3) People with Limited Experience</b> - Singapore is one of the wealthiest nations on the planet and attracts significant investment capital from the surrounding region. Attracted by the potential of big returns, there’s a tremendous amount of money pouring into the VC space. However, many of the accelerators, incubators, and government agencies are led by people with little to no start-up experience, simply because the ecosystem is so new and young. How do you expect a 20-year DBS/OCBC/Singtel company veteran to identify talent and nurture a start-up?</p>
				<p>Societal structures severely limit the start-up potential in Singapore. It’s frustrating to see the Singaporean government trying to nurture the local start-up scene with generous government grants and schemes. Oftentimes, these grants and schemes are taken advantage of by crafty business people who create complex webs of shell companies to essentially collect free money. To combat this, the government creates more stringent eligibility and reporting requirements which shuts out the entrepreneurs that really need the grants and schemes.</p>
				<p>Singapore is entirely focused on FinTech and e-commerce. While these are themes I agree with, is there really a market need for another cryptocurrency wallet or the sixth mobile payment solution? These are sexy start-up ideas which don’t solve any real needs or add any value. Everything related to ecommerce is an obvious theme which every VC in the region is watching. A VC’s competitive advantage comes in one of two ways - either the VC gets to a deal first or sees opportunity where others don’t. Since everyone is watching ecommerce, the VC will only win if they get to a deal first. This leads to an arms race of building relationships and sourcing deals, all which can lead to poor, rushed decisions. Peter Thiel preaches that direct competition is bad since it leads to needlessly wasted resources. Yet, most VCs in Singapore and Southeast Asia are doing just that.</p>
				<p>There’s also an element of feedback that’s at play. George Soros has his Theory of Reflexivity, where stock market prices aren’t a direct reflection of fundamental underpinnings but a reflection of people’s opinions of the fundamental underpinnings. While daily price oscillations are mostly random noise, big booms and busts are manifestations of herd-like behavior where feedback loops run over and over to drive a price irrationally above or below its fundamental value. This principle happens in start-ups and VCs as well, where certain themes grow irrationally due to feedback from media and high-profile funding rounds. You can see this on individual investments as well such as Uber, where investors play hot potato, pushing a valuation beyond what’s rational.</p>
				<p>Singapore’s start-up ecosystem needs more people willing to think outside of the box and willing to express opinions and ideas that stand out. While societal changes will take time, an awareness of the issues today can jump start the process.</p>

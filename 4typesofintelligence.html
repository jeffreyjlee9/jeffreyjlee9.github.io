				<h2 class="col-sm-8 text-left"><u>4 Types of Intelligence</u></h2>
				<p class="col-sm-8 text-left">By: Jeffrey J. Lee<br>November 2016</br></p>
				<h4 class="col-sm-7 text-left"><p>When someone says another person is intelligent, your first instinct is to think that it’s tied to deep academic subject matter expertise or an ability to draw connections across varying and disparate academic or cultural subjects and disciplines. No one would describe Lebron James’ athletic talent as intelligence, it’s “basketball IQ.” Same with Tony Robbins who has a tremendous way with people. This ability isn’t described as intelligence, rather it’s “salesmanship.” Same with Kanye West, it’s “artistic talent.”</p>
				<p>These examples can be collectively classified under “intelligence,” alongside the most commonly accepted type of “academic” intelligence. I believe there’s 4 core types of intelligence:</p>
				<p>	
					<ul>
						<li><b>Academic</b> - This is what you think of when it comes to school - math, science, history, language, etc. Deep knowledge of subject matter information.</li>
						<li><b>Artistic</b> - Anything related to creativity and the arts, including visual art, performance art, dance, theater, fashion, music, and writing. I would also include cultural knowledge and awareness.</li>
						<li><b>Athletic</b> - Physical strength, speed, and agility. Also includes sport specific skills and vision.</li>
						<li><b>Emotional</b> - Knowledge of self and others, including mindfulness, communication, empathy, motivation, and awareness.</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>The modern education system emphasizes academic intelligence. While there’s still a significant divide in education quality and opportunity across the United States and greater nuance can be introduced to resonate with different learning styles, the general framework is at least open to all 4 types of intelligence. Students learn academic subjects in class, express artistic creativity through the arts and music, engage in physical education, and socialize regularly with others. University admissions look at test scores and letter grades in conjunction with talent and achievements in the other 3 types. Individuals can build successful and financially lucrative careers through all 4 types of intelligence.</p>
				<p>Emotional intelligence is often an afterthought and pushed aside. Being incredibly gifted means nothing if you don’t know how to be mindful, communicate, build relationships, and have empathy towards others. I’ve seen incredibly talented, smart people with low emotional intelligence sputter out. I’ve also seen people who dropped out from school with high emotional intelligence, drive, and people skills achieve tremendous professional success.</p>
				<p>Through this framework, Asia’s education system is incredibly flawed. Asia is renowned for having incredibly pressurized, academically driven education systems where students cram information for hours on end to take single-shot, life changing exams. If you don’t successfully adapt to this system, you’re left behind and socially shunned. There’s little room for creative expression, critical thinking, or developing artistic, athletic, and emotional skills. Asia’s model tends to develop and promote academically impressive individuals who lack the other 3 types of intelligence, all the while suppressing individuals with talents in the other 3 intelligence types.</p>
				<p>What’s troubling is that as you look into the future, computers are going to take over jobs and skills that are based solely on information, repetition, and processes. This falls squarely under academic intelligence - this is a baseline commodity which can be accessed easily and which computers dominate. Your advantage as an individual and your ability to provide value will come down to the other 3 types of intelligence, areas where humans clear advantages over computers (at least for now, who knows in the future). Academic intelligence will still be crucial, but it will come down to how you synthesize the information and apply it to unique situations (ex. A surgeon removing a brain tumor, a programmer creating new software).</p>
				<p>It’s important to recognize that there’s more to an individual’s intelligence than simply academic intelligence. Furthermore, it’s crucial to develop and encourage artistic, athletic, and emotional intelligence.</p>

				<h2 class="col-sm-8 text-left"><u>Generating and Validating New Business Ideas</u></h2>
				<p class="col-sm-8 text-left">By: Jeffrey J. Lee<br>November 2016</br></p>
				<h4 class="col-sm-7 text-left"><p>Generating and validating new business ideas has evolved significantly in the past 30 years. During the pre-internet era, most businesses started from a foundational business plan. The business plan was a densely packed, thoroughly researched document that included market analysis, financial projections, and growth models. These business plans would take months if not longer to put together, all to eventually present to local banks to secure a loan to get the idea going.</p>
				<p>This business plan model existed because pre-internet ventures were physical businesses. Whether it was a restaurant, barber shop, or factory, you needed a lot of capital up-front to purchased fixed assets. You needed furniture, cash registers, heavy machinery, and vehicles, not to mention a real estate lease, to get going. A local bank extending the loan needs to know how these physical assets will come together to produce products or services that deliver value. The business plan was the best way for banks to assess risk.</p>
				<p>When I started off thinking about start-ups, I took a similar approach. I adapted the dense business plan to a Powerpoint presentation, jamming it with market sizing, competitive analysis, revenue models, product roadmaps, and more. This was done in isolation, mainly as a thought experiment with minimal validation done through articles I found through Google searches.</p>
				<p>I’ve wasted an incredible amount of effort and mental energy using this approach, with nothing to show for it except countless abandoned Powerpoint presentations in my Dropbox. I realized there’s a better, smarter way to do it. Paul Graham of Y Combinator preaches, “Build something people want.” You can do all the analysis and modeling you want, but at the end of the day, you need to build a compelling product or service that customers will pay money for.</p>
				<p>So how do you figure out what people want? You generate and validate new business ideas by talking directly to potential customers, pushing small experiments out, and getting feedback. While the approach is obvious for software and internet related business, the same principles can also be applied to physical businesses. I’ve come up with 3 crucial steps to generating and validating new business ideas that ensures you’re building something people want.</p>
				<p><b><br>Idea generation</br></b>Talk to potential customers. This is the easiest, best way to come up with new business ideas. If you read something on Techcrunch, Reddit, or some article highlighting the top 10 industries for 2020, you’re probably too late to the party. Many people though take their present condition as is and don’t find anything to be outrageously broken or painful. I’ve found that naivete in a particular industry can actually be a big advantage for idea generation. Certain processes that seem normal and are embedded to industry experts and practitioners can be painfully inefficient or antiquated to an outsider. Take these observations and talk about them with potential customers.</p>
				<p>If you have a problem or inefficiency in your day to day life or work, it’s likely that others do too. Take this idea and talk to other people who might find it useful. If you’re brimming with potential ideas, take these and talk to potential customers about them.</p>
				<p><b><br>Minimum viable product</br></b>This is a common term used in start-ups. A minimum viable product (MVP) is the most stripped down, bare bones version of a product or service you can deliver to your potential customers that still offers value. For a software idea, you can easily create a simple landing page describing your product or service with a button for people to sign-up. From here, you can build a simple V1 of the product and push it out to customers, adding on more features as you get more feedback.</p>
				<p>For a service idea, you can approach customers on a consulting basis, offering clear objectives and deliverables. You can even do this for free initially with a few close business associates, family or friends.</p>
				<p>For a physical business idea, you can get creative with your MVP. For a restaurant idea, you can test menu items and concepts in your home with family and friends, before asking them to invite colleague or extended friends to try it out.</p>
				<p><b><br>Build measure learn</br></b>This idea is from The Lean Start-Up by Eric Reis, which I highly recommend. It’s the process of making small incremental changes, releasing it to customers, measuring results, learning from the results, and cycling again. Rather than building features in isolation for extended periods of time, you push out small, measurable improvements to customers and use their feedback to guide future decisions.</p>
				<p>Working closely with potential customers right from the beginning will help you generate and validate new business ideas. Observe, ask questions, learn, and build!</p>

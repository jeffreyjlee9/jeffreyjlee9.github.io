				<h2 class="col-sm-8 text-left"><u>Early-Stage Investors are Driven By Fear</u></h2>
				<p class="col-sm-8 text-left">By: Jeffrey J. Lee<br>November 2016</br></p>
				<h4 class="col-sm-7 text-left"><p>Incentives drive behavior and action. I’m going to go outside in the rain and buy food because my hunger outweighs the hassle of going outside. I’m going to donate to a charity because my belief in the cause outweighs the value of my money. I’m going to work hard because my job satisfaction outweighs the stress. I’m going to skip a birthday party because my exhaustion outweighs the fun. While these are simple examples and countless other factors play a part, it illustrates how incentives drive people.</p>
				<p>Incentives are separate from whether a certain behavior or action is rational or irrational. The classification of things as rational or irrational depends on societal consensus. Individuals have incentives to behave or act in ways that satisfy personal beliefs, cravings, emotions, and needs. I believe the root comes from the primal incentive to survive (although modern behaviors and actions will rarely tap into this core incentive). Any incentive strong enough will be rational to the individual, independent to societal consensus. Incentives that drive individuals towards behaviors or actions that are rational during a certain point in history might be irrational in a future point in time (ex. Public beheadings of criminals to deter future criminal behavior). Incentives that drive individuals towards behaviors or actions that are irrational during a certain point in history might be rational in a future point in history (ex. Sterilizing surgical instruments between patients to prevent infection). Incentives that drive individuals towards behaviors or actions that are irrational while society is fully aware of it may still proceed (ex. 2000 Dot com boom and bust). Thus, it’s difficult to frame incentives as being rational or irrational.</p>
				<p>When it comes to early-stage, startup investing, investors are incentivized to take risks in companies with uncertain futures because of the potential of a massive return on investment. These incentives are shaped by the investors’ own model of the world, background, experiences, and opinions. Oftentimes, the best investor decisions will have the majority scratching their heads at the time of investment (ex. Uber: Calling a black car on my phone? I can just hail down a cheaper cab faster that’s also more prevalent), while the worst investor decisions will have the majority nodding their heads at the time of investment (ex. Homejoy: Finding cleaning help on my own? I can hire cleaning help right away from a vetted group of professionals easily through a portal, plus the gig economy model is taking over).</p>
				<p>Money is an abstract idea, merely pieces of paper or bits in the cloud that functions on collective belief. When it comes to money, fear dominates human behavior and action. You see it in the financial markets and you see it at the poker table. The best traders and poker players are able to control and suppress their fear, while sometimes taking advantage of others’ fear, to come out on top.</p>
				<p>I believe that the investor incentive to make massive returns is also masked and dominated by fear:
					<ul>
						<li>The fear of making the wrong decision and not getting their money back.</li>
						<li>The fear of missing out on the right decision and not making a massive return on their money.</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>I believe that startup founders most successful with capital raising tap into this investor fear, whether intentionally or unintentionally. Founders change the investors’ fear from making the wrong decision and not getting their money back to the fear of missing out on the right decision and not making a massive return on their money. This is why terrible start-ups sometimes raise lots of capital, either because the investor believes he or she is rational or the group is driven by herd-like irrationality, while excellent start-ups sometimes struggle to raise capital.</p>
				<p>Unfortunately, salesmanship, political maneuvering, and psychological games are a part of any professional success and the same goes for successful early-stage fundraising. I’m hopeful that focusing on building excellent products and nurturing happy customers takes care of the rest.</p>

				<p>Everyone generates a large amount of interesting ideas. The best people are able to quickly filter through them, hone in, and execute. I've worked on being able to cycle through problems and ideas based on potential and executability faster and more efficiently. An evaluation process that might look like haste to an outsider is a careful, practiced, and sharpened iteration cycle made possible through intensive, non-stop mental assessment and comparison to a constantly growing knowledge and experience base. Below is a compilation of start-up problems and ideas I've come up with which I strongly believe have tremendous potential but chose not to pursue due to a lack of genuine interest, an ability to execute, or some other reason. If you have any feedback, feel free to email me at jeffreyjlee at post dot harvard dot edu.</p>

					<h2><u>Problems and (Ideas)</u></h2>
					<ul>
						<li><b>As e-commerce grows in SEA, there will be a growing need for on-demand designing and ordering of custom branded packaging and shipping supplies</b> (SEA web-based platform that allows companies to quickly and easily design and order custom branded cardboard shipping boxes and individual product packaging)</li>
						<li><b>Hotels, restaurants, and gyms have to do laundry internally or outsource it to a partner who's not technology friendly</b> (SEA a centralized laundering service with digital visibility into delivery, collection, progress, and billing)</li>
						<li><b>Lower volume drivers subsidize higher volume drivers, pay-how-you-drive hands over customer data to auto insurers who can price discriminate further</b> (SEA pay-per-kilometer auto insurance)</li>
						<li><b>People want to write longer in-depth pieces, no platform to write and share essays on varying topics</b> (Social platform designed to write and share essays)</li>
						<li><b>Difficult for teams and departments to keep track of project goals and progress</b> (Google Calendar like web app which provides visual timelines of project progress, tasks, and responsibilities)</li>
						<li><b>Consumers can't check or reserve salon, spa, or fitness availability online</b> (OpenTable for salon, spa, and fitness services on consumer side, web-based scheduling management software on service side)</li>
						<li><b>Decreasing NFL popularity, attention spans shrinking, small-bite mobile friendly content</b> (US professional rugby sevens league)</li>
						<li><b>Why do we continue paying restaurant checks by cash or credit card, which can lead to error, long wait times, and stolen information?</b></li>
						<li><b>438 million adults are unbanked in Southeast Asia, how do we give them access to key banking and financial services?</b></li>
						<li><b>Is there a way to produce popular foods (ex. meat, palm oil) in a more environmentally friendly way, either artificially in a lab or compacting farmland?</b></li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div class="col-sm-6 text-left">
					<h2><u>Trends</u></h2>
					<ul>
						<li>The internet will be the most transformative technology in our lifetime.</li>
						<li>More and more things will continue to get connected to the internet creating diverse, enriching networks.</li>
						<li>Apple is starting to lose innovative steam and a new global hardware leader will emerge by 2020.</li>
						<li>Cloud-based software will push into traditional verticals (shipping, manufacturing, agriculture, construction), unlocking incredible value.</li>
						<li>Automation through AI and bots will grow, primarily in data analysis applications as the amount of data continues to explode.</li>
						<li>AR will permeate the workplace in the next 5 years.</li>
						<li>VR will permeate the home in the next 5 years.</li>
						<li>Southeast Asia lags the United States in start-up technology trends and adoption by roughly 4 years.</li>
						<li>Ecommerce will grow exponentially in Southeast Asia with a rapidly growing middle class, increasing internet penetration, and more online trust.</li>

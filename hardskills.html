				<h2 class="col-sm-8 text-left"><u>Hard Skills, Higher Education, and the Real World</u></h2>
				<p class="col-sm-8 text-left">By: Jeffrey J. Lee<br>January 2017</br></p>
				<h4 class="col-sm-7 text-left"><p>There’s a disconnect between higher education and working in the real world. It’s true that education as a whole, including colleges and universities, severely lags the faster and faster pace of innovation going on in the world. Peter Thiel even started a program to discourage promising, bright kids from pursuing higher education to go straight into entrepreneurial pursuits in the real world. You absolutely don’t need higher education to succeed. If you’re a smart, motivated individual, you will find a way to make a positive impact and bring value to the world. However, I think it’s careless and incorrect to say that higher education is irrelevant today.</p>
				<p>In the real world, companies need people who bring defined, hard skills to the table. Hard skills include sales, marketing, engineering, product management, legal, finance, design, HR, and more. These are crafts applicable to a range of different industries. You can also learn a very specific craft like medicine, carpentry, cosmetology, or plumbing. To bring value, you need knowledge and experience in a hard skill.</p>
				<p>The problem with higher education, and more so as you move up school rankings, is that hard skills aren’t emphasized. You typically take a series of general education or core classes across humanities, math, science, and writing before learning a subject in depth with your major. Most majors are extremely broad and vague like political science, business, or mechanical engineering. You can pursue a technical subject like computer science or accounting but it’s still within an academic vacuum that leans more theoretical and not in a real world, practical business context. You can identify your talent and passion while nurturing a specific hard skill through internships, but it’s really a crapshoot until you graduate, get your first job, and work a few years.</p>
				<p>Yet, by pursuing higher education, you get the opportunity to develop other skills you otherwise don’t get from working. With higher education, and particularly at top tier colleges and universities, you expand your awareness and learn how to learn. Most importantly, you learn how to problem solve with professors who do this professionally within their subject matters.</p>
				<p>Problem solving can be broken up into 6 distinct steps:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Identify a problem or problems</li>
					<li>Break problem or problems into smaller addressable pieces</li>
					<li>Source and research information</li>
					<li>Process and analyze information</li>
					<li>Come up with conclusions and solutions</li>
					<li>Identify additional or follow-up lines of inquiry</li>
				</ol>
				<p>Within this problem solving process, you must also gauge how horizontal (broad or specific) or vertical (shallow or deep) you get when you frame the question, gather information, and formulate conclusions.</p>
				<p>In higher education, you get to practice this problem solving process repeatedly in a relatively low-stakes environment. Whether you study economics, anthropology, chemistry, music, classics, or math doesn’t matter. Learn and hone the problem solving process in a subject you’re genuinely interested in.</p>
				<p>After higher education, you need to adapt this problem solving process to a specific hard skill or skills. Instead of formulating questions around a 10 page paper, you need to formulate questions around business analytics or product design. Making this connection between problem solving, the most important thing you will learn in higher education, and hard skills, the direct application to a company, can take some time. Once you do make the connection, the breadth, depth, and efficiency with which you can tackle various business problems will be immense.</p>

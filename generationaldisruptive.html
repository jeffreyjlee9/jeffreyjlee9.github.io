				<h2 class="col-sm-8 text-left"><u>Generational Disruptive Consumer Technologies</u></h2>
				<p class="col-sm-8 text-left">By: Jeffrey J. Lee<br>November 2016</br></p>
				<h4 class="col-sm-7 text-left"><p>Every generation is defined by one or two pervasive, disruptive consumer technologies that change the course of human history. These technologies have added unfathomable amounts of value to society, spawned legendary companies, and created entrepreneurial fortunes. Below is a list with the years in which the biggest disruptive consumer technologies started booming from the past 150 years.</p>
				<p>
					<ul>
						<li>1880 - Electricity</li>
						<li>1885 - Automobile</li>
						<li>1900 - Telephone</li>
						<li>1920 - Radio</li>
						<li>1950 - Television</li>
						<li>1980 - Personal computer</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>Many people lament that all billion dollar ideas have been executed already or are being pursued by someone or by a large, publically traded company today. These people think they’ve missed the gravy train. This couldn’t be further from the truth. Take a look at the four lists of the top 10 public companies sorted by market capitalization across 1985, 1995, 2005, and 2015.</p>

				<p>While regulatory changes play a big part as well, these charts illustrate the significant effect technological changes have even in 10 year increments. Many of the biggest, most relevant, value adding companies of 2030, 2040, and 2050 haven’t even been created yet. This is an incredible thing to realize and illustrates the sheer wealth of opportunities that are waiting to be pursued now.</p>
				<p>It’s also important to realize from these charts that the overall economic pie isn’t static and that these companies moving up or down doesn’t mean they’re simply taking or losing a greater share of the pie. Technological changes unlock new sources of value which expand the pie practically overnight while more efficient distribution channels allow large swathes of this value to be captured faster and easier.</p>
				<p>Today, we’re in the midst of not one, but two generational, breakthrough consumer technologies -  the internet (1995 onwards) and the smartphone (2007 onwards). While significant value has already been unlocked directly by and through derivatives of these two technologies, we’re past the boom/bust phase and are in the multi-decade growth phase. Looking back at the 150 year list of technologies, you’ll notice that each technology started with a sharp boom/bust phase, followed by steady multi-decade growth, before tapering off with consolidation through competition, acquisition, and M&A activity to a few major players.</p>
				<p>You’ll notice that even for these legacy consumer technologies, there’s still new entrepreneurial opportunities being unlocked today (Automobile – Tesla, autonomous vehicles) as well as variations on delivery and branding made possible by new technologies (Automobile - Uber, Radio – Pandora, Television – Netflix).</p>
				<p>The internet and the smartphone will be our generation’s defining disruptive consumer technologies, and there’s still an incredible amount of entrepreneurial value waiting to be unlocked. Looking into the near future, I strongly believe VR will be the next defining consumer technology that will go mainstream with a large boom in the next 5 years.</p>
